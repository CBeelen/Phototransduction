Code to reproduce the simulations and figures for manuscript "A hybrid stochastic/deterministic model of single photon response and light adaptation in mouse rods." by C. Beelen, S. Asteriti, L. Cangiano, K.-W. Koch and D. Dell'Orco, [Manuscript link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2021.06.033)

Requirements to run the simulations:
- MATLAB (at least R2018A for the “lowpass” function)
- Signal Processing Toolbox (Matlab)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (Matlab)
- [IQMtools](https://iqmtools.intiquan.com)

More details on the simulations and results can be found in my dissertation! [Link to the PDF](http://oops.uni-oldenburg.de/4738/1/beemod20.pdf)
